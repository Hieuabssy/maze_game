# 🚀 Maze Game

## 📖 Introduction

Maze Game is a maze-based puzzle game developed entirely in Python. The game generates mazes randomly, ensuring a unique experience each time you play. You take on the role of **Tom** (the hunter) with the mission to find **Jerry** (the exit). The game supports two maze-solving algorithms:

- 🔍 **DFS (Depth-First Search)** - Explores depth-first.
- 🔍 **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** - Explores breadth-first.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🏗 **Random Maze Generation** using specialized algorithms.
- 🛤 **Two Maze-Solving Algorithms**: DFS and BFS.
- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Players must log in to play; if they don't have an account, they must register.
- 💾 **Game Save Feature**: Allows players to save progress and continue later.
- 🎨 **Modern Graphical Interface**:
  - 🖥 **PyQt5** for the main user interface.
  - 🎮 **Pygame** for handling and rendering game graphics.
- 🐍 **100% Python-based**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python
- 🎨 PyQt5 (GUI framework)
- 🎮 Pygame (Graphics handling)
